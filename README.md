# hello-world

Hi, I’m Barr
I’m a Computer Science student in the Open university of Israel.
Interested in understanding everything I get to touch or hear of.
I’m a 2nd year student in the university and working in Caja robotics as QA and service engineer.
I’m looking to find interesting to collaborate with, still not sure at what field I want to focus on.
